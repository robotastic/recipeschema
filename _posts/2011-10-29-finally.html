<p>Well....after making a living as a web developer for several years, I am finally doing the common sense thing and maintaining a blog. There is just so much to learn, and therefore so much to document!</p>

<p>Having a blog just seems like a great place to write down my thoughts and explorations (those of you that have been doing this for years, please keep your "duhs" to yourselves).</p>

<p>It is my hope that this blog will serve to reinforce the things I have spent so much time learning, and also help others learn from my discoveries.</p>

<p>I hope to share my various conquests and humiliations on the intarwebz - that is my ongoing love affair with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Let's not forget the server side languages and the slew of frameworks and systems that accompany them. I hope this will be a worthwhile journey for all involved..</p>

<p>I am sure there is much left undone before I set out on this journey, but here I go....</p>
